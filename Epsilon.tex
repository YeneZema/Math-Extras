\textbf{\large Precise Definition of Limit}\\
Let $f(x)$ be defined on an open interval about $x_0$, except possibly at $x_0$ itself. We say that the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $x_0$ is the number L, written as
$$
\lim_{x\rightarrow x_0} f(x)=L
$$
For every number $\epsilon >0$ , there exists a corresponding number $\delta >0$. Such that for all $x$.
$$0<|x-x_0|<\delta\Rightarrow|f(x)-L|<\epsilon$$

Let $D$ be a subset of $\bf R$ and let
$f \colon D \to \mathbf{R}$ be a real-valued function on
$D$. The function $f$ is said to be \emph{continuous} on
$D$ if, for all $\epsilon > 0$ and for all $x \in D$,
there exists some $\delta > 0$ (which may depend on $x$)
such that if $y \in D$ satisfies

One may readily verify that if $f$ and $g$ are continuous
functions on $D$ then the functions $f+g$, $f-g$ and
$f.g$ are continuous. If in addition $g$ is everywhere
non-zero then $f/g$ is continuous.
